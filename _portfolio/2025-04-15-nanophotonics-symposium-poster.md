## Abstract

[cite_start]Structural colors, seen in butterfly wings and peacock feathers, are produced by the interaction of light with subwavelength nanostructures. [cite: 6] [cite_start]Unlike pigments, these colors are geometry-defined, making them exceptionally fade-resistant and tunable with nanometer-scale precision. [cite: 7] [cite_start]This work explores structural color generation using dielectric metasurfaces as a potential energy-efficient alternative to LEDs for display technologies. [cite: 8] [cite_start]We investigate metasurfaces fabricated from silicon-rich nitride (SRN), a material offering a high refractive index and low optical loss in the visible spectrum. [cite: 9] [cite_start]By adjusting the silane-to-nitrogen (SiH₄:N₂) gas ratio during its PECVD deposition, the material's refractive index and extinction coefficient can be continuously tuned. [cite: 10] [cite_start]This provides unparalleled control over the resulting structural color, demonstrating a promising path toward advanced, tunable optical devices. [cite: 11]
