## Abstract
[cite_start]Structural colors, unlike pigment-based hues, are produced by nanoscale structures whose geometry creates color, offering superior durability, tunability, and fade resistance[cite: 27]. [cite_start]This work explores structural color generation using metasurfacesâ€”ultra-thin, engineered materials that use nano-scale patterns to precisely manipulate light[cite: 25]. [cite_start]We investigated metasurfaces fabricated from silicon-rich nitride (SRN), a material that enables continuous tuning of both its refractive index and extinction coefficient by adjusting the gas ratio during deposition, providing unparalleled design flexibility[cite: 29].

## Methodology
[cite_start]We simulated periodic arrays of four distinct nanostructure geometries: Cross With Disks, Cross, Disks, and Cross With Squares[cite: 53, 26, 28, 39, 40]. [cite_start]The simulations were performed using Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA), a computational method used to determine how light interacts with periodic structures[cite: 19, 53]. [cite_start]The resulting reflectance spectra from these simulations were used to generate a comprehensive spectral library[cite: 54].

## Computation Results
[cite_start]To visualize the range of achievable colors, each spectrum from the library was plotted as a point on a CIE chromaticity diagram[cite: 55]. [cite_start]The results show that modifying the nanostructure geometry provides direct control over the achievable color gamut[cite: 56]. This allows for precise color generation based on the design.

## Future Direction
[cite_start]Our next step is to fabricate a device featuring the VINSE logo[cite: 62]. [cite_start]We will also work to achieve a broader color palette by exploring new nanostructure geometries and optimizing SRN deposition recipes for enhanced optical properties[cite: 63].

## Acknowledgements
[cite_start]Funding was provided by the SyBBure Searle Program[cite: 65]. [cite_start]Sincere gratitude to my PI Jason Valentine, my mentor Rahul Shah, the VINSE staff, and the entire Valentine Lab members for their exceptional guidance and mentorship[cite: 65].
