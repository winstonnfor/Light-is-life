I'm curious about how light interacts with matter on the nanoscale and how we can develop new technologies from this understanding. My current focus is on nanophotonics and metasurfaces, particularly their applications in quantum photonics, AR/VR, green energy, and data systems.

In my research at Vanderbilt University's NanOptics Lab, guided by Professor Jason Valentine, I've explored inverse design and machine learning to create nanostructures, using tools like RCWA, MATLAB, and Python. This has helped me build a strong theoretical and computational foundation.

To complement this, I also serve as a Maintenance and Safety Technician at the VINSE Cleanroom. This role has given me valuable practical skills in cleanroom operations and a broader perspective on the hands-on considerations essential to nanofabrication.

I am eager to continue learning as a researcher and hope to find a collaborative environment where I can contribute to meaningful progress at the forefront of photonics.
